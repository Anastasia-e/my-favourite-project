### Create a new user on GitHub

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new user for yourself.

### Set up GitHub application

Once you have your account registered do these steps:

- download GitHub for Mac. Get it [here](https://mac.github.com/)
- extract the zip file and drag the app to /Applications
- start the app
- sign in with your GitHub account

### Clone this repository

Start by opening Finder and creating these new folders:

- ```/Users/{{myusername}}/dev```
- ```/Users/{{myusername}}/dev/my-favourite-project```

In browser, click the button "Clone in Desktop" on the right navigation bar at github's project page.

Your browser will probably prompt for application launch. Allow this.

Follow the steps in the app and point the clone to be located at

	/Users/{{myusername}}/dev/my-favourite-project

The app now copies the file(s) from GitHub repository to your own computer.
