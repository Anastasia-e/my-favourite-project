# My first push

### 1. Create a new user on GitHub

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new user for yourself.

IMPORTANT: Submit your username to Sampo and Juho from [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sPgajPRnoF4w3GFfciVIQS-Jz2V1MQLKMnuSfiMLOJ4/viewform) so we can add you rights to the project.

### 2. Set up GitHub application

Once you have your account registered do these steps:

- download GitHub for Mac. Get it [here](https://mac.github.com/)
- extract the zip file and drag the app to /Applications
- start the app
- sign in with your GitHub account

### 3. Clone this repository

Start by opening Finder and creating new folders:

- ```/Users/{{myusername}}/dev```

Back in browser, click the button "Clone in Desktop" on the right navigation bar at github's project page.

Your browser will probably prompt for application launch. Allow this.

Follow the steps in the GitHub app and point the clone to be located at your new folder:

	/Users/{{myusername}}/dev/
	
The app now syncs this project repository from GitHub to your own computer.

You now see all the changes made through the app. Press button "Changes" from left navigation.

Open Finder again and go to the folder you just cloned. You should see a single file called ```README.md```. Double click the file and it should open in TextEdit.

### 4. Modify README.md file

List of people who know how to use GitHub:
- Sampo H
- Juho H
- Kirka B
- Saara S
- Jason H
- Jonas F
- Ville YK
- Antonia

Save your changes in the file.

### 5. Commit your changes to GitHub

Go back to the app again. Make sure the checkbox in file ```README.md``` is toggled in the app. If you click the file you should see all the changes you made. Write a public summary message to describe your modifications. For example, you can use the following message:
	
	Add {{Your name here}} in readme

Press button "Commit". You should now see a new section, "Unsynced Commits" with a commit message line. Press button "Sync".

### 6. Go back to browser and refresh. 
	
Pat yourself in the back and enjoy.

### There's always the the web interface fallback ...
